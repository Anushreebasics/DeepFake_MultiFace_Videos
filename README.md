# DeepFake MultiFace Videos Detection

This repository contains a full-stack project deployed using Flask and integrated with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) sequential model. The project focuses on deepfake detection in video datasets, particularly addressing scenarios where videos contain multiple persons.

## Project Overview

Deepfake technology has raised concerns regarding its potential misuse, particularly in creating fabricated content involving individuals. This project aims to tackle such issues by providing a solution capable of detecting deepfake videos, even in cases where multiple persons are involved.

The application has practical implications, such as combating deepfake pornography and aiding law enforcement in identifying potential instances of deepfake manipulation, for example, in cases of child abduction where kidnappers might fabricate videos to mislead investigations.

## Features
* Deepfake detection in videos with multiple persons.
* Frontend developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Deployment through Flask.
* Integration with a CNN sequential model.

## Usage
To use this application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gilhotraapoorva/DeepFake_MultiFace_Videos.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd DeepFake_MultiFace_Videos
```
3. Run the Flask application by executing the app2.py file:

```
python3 app2.py

```
4. Once the server is running, access the application by clicking on the "Try it now" button on the website.
5. Upload a video file by clicking on the "Choose file" button, then click on "Upload". The application will process the video and provide the result indicating the presence of deepfake manipulation.

## Disclaimer
This project is developed for educational and research purposes only. The accuracy and reliability of the deepfake detection algorithm may vary based on various factors, and it should not be solely relied upon for critical applications without proper validation and verification.
